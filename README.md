## Overview

This repository contains the Billie release of the Legato SDK. The SDK includes APIs for Service Catalog, Service Order, Service Inventory and Service Notification functions of the Service Orchestration Functionality (SOF) at the LSO Legato Interface Reference Point (IRP) as defined in the MEF LSO Reference Architecture.

This version updates the payload schemas for:

- Carrier Ethernet (based on MEF 7.4),
- SD-WAN (based on MEF 82) and
- L1CS (based on MEF 111).

**NOTE:** Some parts of the release are for MEF Members only, such as the draft, in-progress versions of the API Developer Guides for each of the service types listed above.

## Scope

It includes API definitions for the following functional areas:

- Service Catalog - This includes support for
  - Service Specification - Retrieve operations only
  - Not in scope
    - Service Specifications - Create, Amend/Modify, Delete operations
    - Service Catalog, Service Category, Service Candidate, Job/Task
- Service Ordering - This includes support for
  - Service Order/OrderItem - Create, Retrieve operations only
  - Not in scope
    - Service Order/OrderItem - Amend/Modify/Cancel, Delete operations

## Maturity Level

The API files contained in this SDK are evolving and subject to change. They are based on documents that are either work in progress or draft standards that have not yet completed the review cycles and approvals necessary to achieve the status as a MEF standard. MEF is making these publicly available at this time to invite wider industry review.

There is currently [LSO Legato Service Provisioning Project](https://wiki.mef.net/display/LSO/LSO+Legato+Service+API+-+Project+Home+Page) open that aims to  deliver:

- LSO Legato Service Provisioning API (MEF W99)
  - OAS3 API/Schema definitions as YAML files **(DRAFT, part of this SDK release)**
  - API Developer Guide as GFM file **(To be delivered)**
- LSO Legato Service Provisioning Specification - SD-WAN (MEF W100)
  - JSON Schema definitions as YAML files **(DRAFT, part of this SDK release)**
  - Schema Guide as GFM file **(DRAFT, part of this SDK release)**
- LSO Legato Service Provisioning Specification - Carrier Ethernet (MEF W101)
  - JSON Schema definitions as YAML files **(DRAFT, part of this SDK release)**
  - Schema Guide as GFM file **(DRAFT, part of this SDK release)**
- LSO Legato Service Provisioning Specification - L1 (MEF W103)
  - JSON Schema definitions as YAML files **(DRAFT, part of this SDK release)**
  - Schema Guide as GFM file **(DRAFT, part of this SDK release)**
