title: MEF LSO Legato - L1 SLS Specification
description:
  The Subscriber L1VC Service Level Specification (SLS) Service Attribute is the technical speci-fication of aspects of the service performance agreed to by the Service Provider and the Sub-scriber. For any given SLS, a given Performance Metric may or may not be specified.

      This attribute sets the time interval to evaluate the performance
      for the SLS.  All performances of this SLS use the same time interval T, which
      itself may not be constrained, e.g., 1 month.
