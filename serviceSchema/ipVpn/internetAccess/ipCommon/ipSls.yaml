title: MEF LSO Cantata-Sonata Internet Access UNI Access Link Service Specifications
description: The IPVC Service Level Specificaiton (SLS) describes the performance objectives for the performance of conformant IP Data Packets that flow over the IPVC. The IPVC Service Level Specification Attribute is either None, or a four-tuple of the form (s,T,E,L) where s is the start time, T is a period of time, E is a set of SLS entries and L is a set of the CoS Name and number of other parameters specific to the Performance Metric. Reference MEF 61.1 Section 10.9 IPVC Service Level Specification Service Attribute.
