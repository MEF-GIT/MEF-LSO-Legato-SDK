      The IPVC Service Level Specification (SLS) describes the performance
      objectives for the performance of conformant IP Data Packets that flow
      over the IPVC. The IPVC Service Level Specification Attribute is either
      None, or a four-tuple of the form (s,T,E,L) where s is the start time, T
      is a period of time, E is a set of SLS entries and L is a set of the CoS
      Name and number of other parameters specific to the Performance Metric.
