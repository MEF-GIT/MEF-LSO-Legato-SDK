      Attribute indicates the type of BGP Peering used across the ENNI. The possible values 
      are Option A, Option B, Option C or Option B and C. They refer to the options described 
      in RFC 4364. Reference MEF 61.1 Section 15.2 ENNI Peering Type Common Attribute. For 
      Options refer-ence MEF 61.1 Section 8.6 Connecting Services across an ENNI.
      OPTION_A is a separate eBGP session is used across each ENNI Link and each session 
      carries routes for one service. This results in packets for different services being 
      sent over different ENNI Links. The packets can be plain IP Packets since it is the 
      different links that distinguish them.
      OPTION_B is for when one or more eBGP sessions are used across the ENNI, each exchanging 
      labelled VPN routes for multiple services. The routes for different services are 
      distinguished by attributes such a Route Distinguishers and Route Targets. This results 
      in IP Packets across the ENNI being encapsulated in MPLS where IP Packets for different 
      services have different MPLS labels. Typically, each packet has a single MPLS label, that 
      identifies both the egress PE and the service.
      OPTION_C is for when one or more eBGP sessions are used across the ENNI only to distribute 
      labeled unicast routes (and labels) towards each Operator's own routers; furthermore, 
      multi-hop eBGP sessions are used between the ingress PE and the egress PE (or equivalent 
      route reflectors) to exchange labelled VPN routes for each service.  This results in IP 
      Packets across the ENNI being encapsulated in MPLS, typically with two MPLS labels, one 
      representing the egress PE, and the second that (roughly speaking) identifies the service.
      OPTIONS_B_AND_C is a combination of Options B and C.

    - OPTION_A

      For an ENNI using Option A, the ENNI Service Map Common Attribute is a mapping from ENNI Service Mapping Contexts a set of ENNI Link Identifiers for ENNI Links in the ENNI. Reference MEF 61.1[1] Section 15.6.1 ENNI Service Map for Option A.

      The ENNI List of ENNI Links Common Attribute is a list of 3-tuples of the form (ID, L1, Links). Each entry in the list corresponds to a distinct L1 link across the ENNI – in most cases, this means a separate physical link (although virtual or logical links are not precluded). The first element in the 3-tuple, ID, is the identifier of the L1 link. The second element, L1, contains the details of the L1 technology used for the link. The third element, Links, is a list (possibly empty) of ENNI Link Identifiers (see section 16.1) for the ENNI Links in this ENNI that traverse the L1 link. Reference MEF 61.1 Section 15.3 ENNI List of ENNI Links Common Attribute.
