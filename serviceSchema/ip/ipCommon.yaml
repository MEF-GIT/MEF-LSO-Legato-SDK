      RFC 7419 specifies a set of common intervals which are used to ensure

      - NONE: No BFD authentication.
      - SIMPLE_PASSWORD: Simple Password Authentication is the most 
      straightforward (and weakest) form of authentication. In this method
      of authentication one or more Passwords (with corresponding Key IDs) 
      are configured in each system and one of these Password/ID pairs is 
      carried in each BFD Control packet. The receiving system accepts the 
      packet if the Password and Key ID matches one of the Password/ID 
      pairs configured in that system. Reference IETF RFC5880 Section 6.7.2.
      - KEYED_MD5: The Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Key MD5 Authentication 
      mechanisms are very similar to those used in other protocols. 
      In these methods of authentication, one or more security keys 
      (with corresponding key IDs) are configured in each system. 
      Reference RFC5880 Section 6.7.3 Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Keyed MD5 
      Authentication.
      - METICULOUS_KEYED_MD5: The Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Key MD5 
      Authentication mechanisms are very similar to those used in other 
      protocols. In these methods of authentication, one or more security
      keys (with corresponding key IDs) are configured in each system.
      Reference RFC5880 Section 6.7.3 Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Keyed MD5
      Authentication.
      - KEYED_SHA1: The Keyed SHA1 and Meticulous Key SHA1 Authentication
      mechanisms are very similar to those used in other protocols. In 
      these methods of authentication, one or more secret keys (with 
      corresponding key IDs) are configured in each system. Reference
      RFC5880 Section 6.7.4 Keyed SHA1 and Meticulous Keyed SHA1 
      Authentication.
