description: A CarrierEthernetEvcEndPoint is a construct at a UNI that selects a subset of the Service Frames that pass over the UNI. A CarrierEthernetEvcEndPoint represents the logical attachment of an EVC to a UNI. Reference MEF 10.4 Section 10 EVC EP Service Attributes. NOTE-CarrierEthernetEvcEndPoint inherits from CarrierEthernetServiceEndPoint.
