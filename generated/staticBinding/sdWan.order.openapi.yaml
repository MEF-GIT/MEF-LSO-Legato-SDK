        This operation returns a list of Service Order instances matching the
        query parameters from the Service Order management system maintained by
        the SOF. Attribute selection is possible using the ''fields'' parameter
        to filter retrieved attribute(s) for each Service Order instance.
        If an exception is encountered, then appropriate returnCode and error
        information is populated and returned as specified.

        This operation creates a Service Order instance in the Service Order
        management system maintained by the SOF. A Service Order is used to
        request operations on a Service instance. A Service Order groups one
        or more one Service Order Items - one per specific action on a Service
        instance. The Action associated with the Service Order Item describes
        the operation (add, remove, update) to be applied on the specified
        Service instance. The Service Order Item and its associated Action can
        operate on both existing (remove, update) as well as future (add)
        Service instance. The Service Order is triggered from the Business
        Application (BA) system in charge of the Product Order management to
        the Service Orchestration Function (SOF) system that will orchestrate
        the Service fulfillment. The assumption is that the Service
        Specifications describing the Service instance in the Service Order
        Item are already available (to both BA & SOF). If an exception is
        encountered, then appropriate returnCode and error information is
        populated and returned as specified.

        A Service Order is used to request operations on a Service instance.
        A Service Order groups one or more one Service Order Items - one per
        specific action on a Service instance. The Action associated with the
        Service Order Item describes the operation (add, remove, update) to be
        applied on the specified Service instance.The Service Order Item and
        its associated Action can operate on both existing (remove, update) as
        well as future (add) Service instance.The Service Order is triggered
        from the Business Application (BA) system in charge of the Product Order
        management to the Service Orchestration Function (SOF) system that will
        orchestrate the Service fulfillment.
