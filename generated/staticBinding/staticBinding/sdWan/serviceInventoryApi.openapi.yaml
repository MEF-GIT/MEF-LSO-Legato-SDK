    The Service Inventory API provides a standardized mechanism for retrieving 
    *ServiceInstances*. Using these APIs Business Applications (BUS) systems 
    query the **Service Inventory** system for *ServiceInstances* that were 
    created by the **Service Order Management** system in the Service 
    Orchestration Function (SOF).

    Additionally, the APIs also allow the BUS to register listeners to be 
    notified of the changes to the *ServiceInstances*.
