            different types. For example, a UNI or ENNI Service may not have any
            relationships, but an Access E-Line may have two mandatory
            relationships (related to the UNI on one end and the ENNI on the
            other). More complex Services such as multipoint IP or Firewall
            Services may have more complex relationships. As a result, the
            allowed and mandatory `relationshipType` values are defined in the
            Service Specification.
