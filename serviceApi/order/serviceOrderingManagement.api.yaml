        A Service Order is used to request operations on a Service instance. A
        Service Order groups one or more one Service Order Items - one per
        specific action on a Service instance. The Action associated with the
        Service Order Item describes the operation (add, modify, delete) to be
        applied on the specified Service instance.The Service Order Item and its
        associated Action can operate on both existing (modify, delete) as well
        as future (add) Service instance.The Service Order is triggered from the
        Business Application (BA) system in charge of the Service Order
        management to the Service Orchestration Function (SOF) system that will
        orchestrate the Service fulfillment.

        This type defines all attributes common to objects used in request and
        response.

        associated Action can operate on both existing (modify, delete) as well

        Business Application (BA) system in charge of the Service Order
        management to the Service Orchestration Function (SOF) system that will
        orchestrate the Service fulfillment.
