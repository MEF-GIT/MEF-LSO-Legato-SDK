        A Service Level Specification represents a pre-defined or negotiated set
        of Service Level Objectives. In addition, certain consequences are 
        associated with not meeting the Service Level Objectives. Service Level 
        Agreements are expressed in terms of Service Level Specifications.

    ServiceSpecification:
      description: |-
        ServiceSpecification offers the ability to describe the characteristics
        of a specific type of service. Functionally, it acts as a template by
        which Services may be instantiated. By sharing the same specification,
        these services would therefore share the same set of characteristics.

        bandwidth would be a ServiceSpecCharacteristic for that particular
        Service.
